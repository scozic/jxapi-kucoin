# JXAPI-KUCOIN
## Kucoin Exchange Java wrapper

This is a Java wrapper for the Kucoin Exchange API. It provides a convenient way to interact with the Kucoin cryptocurrency exchange using Java.

It has been developed as part of the [JXAPI](https://github.com/scozic/jxapi-core) project, which aims to provide Java wrappers for any REST/Websocket API.

See the generated [README](./Kucoin_README.md) for more details about the available endpoints, configuration, and usage examples.

## Important notice

Since I am not actively using Kucoin, this wrapper may not be fully up-to-date with the latest API changes and some endpoints have not been tested. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. The description of the endpoints is generated from the official Kucoin API documentation, but the actual implementation may require adjustments. Look at YAML files in the `src/main/resources/jxapi/exchange/kucoin` folder to see the details of each endpoint.
