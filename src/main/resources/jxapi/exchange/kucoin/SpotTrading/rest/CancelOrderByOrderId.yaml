          <strong>TIP</strong>:<i> This interface is only for cancellation requests. 
          The cancellation result needs to be obtained by querying the order status or 
          subscribing to websocket. It is recommended that you DO NOT cancel the order 
          until receiving the Open message, otherwise the order cannot be cancelled successfully.</i>
