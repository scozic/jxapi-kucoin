          Place order in the Cross-margin or Isolated-margin trading system. 
          You can place two major types of order: Limit and market. 
          Orders can only be placed if your account has sufficient funds. 
          Once an order is placed, your funds will be put on hold for the duration of the order. 
          The amount of funds on hold depends on the order type and parameters specified.
