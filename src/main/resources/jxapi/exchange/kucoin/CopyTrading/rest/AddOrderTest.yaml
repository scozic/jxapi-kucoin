          You can place two types of orders: limit and market. Orders can only be placed if your account has sufficient funds. Once an order is placed, your
          funds will be put on hold for the duration of the order. The amount of funds on hold depends on the order type and parameters specified. <br/>Please be noted
          that the system would hold the fees from the orders entered the orderbook in advance. Read Get Fills to learn more.
