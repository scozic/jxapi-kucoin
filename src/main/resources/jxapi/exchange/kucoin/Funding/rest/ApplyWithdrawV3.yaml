          <strong>TIP</strong>:
          On the WEB end, you can open the switch of specified favorite addresses for withdrawal, and when it is turned on, it will verify whether 
          your withdrawal address(including chain) is a favorite address(it is case sensitive); if it fails validation, it will respond with the 
          error message {"msg":"Already set withdraw whitelist, this address is not favorite address","code":"260325"}.

                Withdrawal fee deduction type: INTERNAL or EXTERNAL or not specified.<ul>
                <li>1. INTERNAL- deduct the transaction fees from your withdrawal amount</li>
                <li>2. EXTERNAL- deduct the transaction fees from your main account</li>
                <li>3. If you don't specify the feeDeductType parameter, when the balance in your main account is sufficient to support the withdrawal,
                the system will initially deduct the transaction fees from your main account. But if the balance in your main account is not sufficient to support the withdrawal,
                the system will deduct the fees from your withdrawal amount. For example: Suppose you are going to withdraw 1 BTC from the KuCoin platform (transaction fee: 0.0001BTC), 
                if the balance in your main account is insufficient, the system will deduct the transaction fees from your withdrawal amount. In this case, you will be receiving 0.9999BTC. 
                <li>4. Lightning Network can only deduct internally</li>
                </ul>
