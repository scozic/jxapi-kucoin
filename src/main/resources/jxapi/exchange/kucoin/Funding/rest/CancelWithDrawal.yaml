          <strong>TIP</strong>:
          On the WEB end, you can open the switch of specified favorite addresses for withdrawal, and when it is turned on, it will verify whether 
          your withdrawal address(including chain) is a favorite address(it is case sensitive); if it fails validation, it will respond with the 
          error message {"msg":"Already set withdraw whitelist, this address is not favorite address","code":"260325"}.
