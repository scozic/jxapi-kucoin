          Request via this endpoint to get a list of open orders for a symbol.<br>
          Level-2 order book includes all bids and asks (aggregated by price), this level returns only one size for each active price (as if there was only a single order for that price).<br>
          Query via this endpoint and the system will return only 20 pieces of the order book to you (ask and bid data).<br>
          You are recommended to request via this endpoint as the system reponse would be faster and cosume less traffic.<br>
          To maintain up-to-date Order Book, please use Websocket incremental feed after retrieving the Level 2 snapshot.<br>
