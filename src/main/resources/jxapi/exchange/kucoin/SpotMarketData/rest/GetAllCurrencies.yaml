          For a coin, the "currency" is a fixed value and works as the only recognized identity of the coin. As the "name", "fullnane" and "precision" of a coin are modifiable values, when the "name" of a coin is changed, you should use "currency" to get the coin.
          For example: The "currency" of XRB is "XRB", if the "name" of XRB is changed into "Nano", you should use "XRB" (the currency of XRB) to search the coin.
