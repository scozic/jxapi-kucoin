                    Before going live, the system will pre-generate the first funding rate record to ensure 
                    the billing cycle can start immediately after the contract is launched.
                    The timePoint field represents the time the funding rate data was generated, not 
                    the actual time it takes effect or is settled.
                    The first actual settlement will occur at the designated settlement time (00:00 / 08:00 / 14:00) 
                    after the contract goes live.
